To hide an item on the menu based on who is logged in, go to main_menu.xml and set the item to android:visible="false"
Then go to main activity and make it visible based on the user
if (type.equals("donor")){
                       nav_menu.findItem(R.id.notifications).setVisible(true);
                   }

Implement on click on the menu with the main activity case and add intent to activity 

His MySalonAdapter is MyBranchAdapter
//His Salon is my branch

MyBranchAdapter
intent.putExtra(Common.KEY_STEP, 1);  //Might need to disable this

Booking Activity 
int step = intent.getIntExtra(Common.KEY_STEP, 0); //Might need to disable this

BookingStep2 initView()
GridLayoutManager gridLayoutManager = new GridLayoutManager(getActivity(), 3);  //Might need to be 2

if (Common.currentTimeSlot != -1)   //Might need to remove this from Booking Activity step 3

Under BookingInformation.java ynder Model remove all the retun that you added just in case
